        <p class="info" id="intro">
            Seraphim is the social awareness club of IIIT Lucknow, dedicated to creating a positive impact on society. With a focus on community service and awareness campaigns, we strive to make a meaningful difference in people's lives. At IIIT Lucknow, Seraphim stands as a beacon of awareness, empathy, and change. Our mission is to create an informed and compassionate community that actively engages with pressing social issues. From environmental sustainability and mental health awareness to gender equality and inclusivity, Seraphim fosters dialogue and initiates action that resonates beyond campus walls. <br> <br>
    
            We believe in the power of collective effort to drive positive change, empowering students to not only understand the societal challenges around them but also to take meaningful steps toward resolving them. Through workshops, campaigns, discussions, and outreach programs, Seraphim is committed to nurturing socially conscious individuals who are ready to make a lasting impact on the world. <br> <br>
    
            Our initiatives extend beyond just raising awareness; we aim to inspire action. Seraphim organizes events that unite students, faculty, and the larger community, encouraging them to collaborate on solutions for real-world problems. Be it through clean-up drives, tree-plantation events, blood donation camps, or mental health counseling sessions, our activities are grounded in the belief that small actions, when multiplied by many, can create waves of transformation. <br> <br>
    
            At Seraphim, we emphasize inclusivity and representation, creating a safe space for all voices to be heard. By leveraging the diverse perspectives of our members, we craft innovative solutions and amplify underrepresented issues. We also partner with NGOs, local organizations, and industry experts to bring meaningful projects to life, ensuring that our efforts have a sustainable and measurable impact. <br> <br>
    
            In a rapidly changing world, Seraphim acts as a platform for proactive leadership and growth, where students can develop critical skills such as empathy, teamwork, and communication. We believe that every individual has the potential to be a changemaker, and our goal is to provide the tools and opportunities to make that vision a reality. Together, we aspire to create a ripple effect of positivity, transcending boundaries and building a better tomorrow for everyone.

                Creating an environment where menstruation is better understood, respected and supported.
